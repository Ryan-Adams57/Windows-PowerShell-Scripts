Tips for Managing and Scheduling Scripts:

Scheduling: Use Task Scheduler to automate these scripts to run at specific intervals, like daily, weekly, or monthly.

Reporting: Customize your scripts by filtering results and including more detailed reports (e.g., filtering for specific users or teams).

Permissions: Ensure you have the necessary permissions to run reports, especially when pulling sensitive data or accessing audit logs.
