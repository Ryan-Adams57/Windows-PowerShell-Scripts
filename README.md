# Introduction

Welcome to this comprehensive repository of PowerShell solutions designed for the modern Microsoft 365 administrator.

This collection features a robust set of scripts engineered to streamline environment management, automate complex reporting, and facilitate deep auditing.

# Key Features

Extensive Collection: A versatile library of PowerShell scripts covering a wide array of administrative domains.

Workflow Automation: Eliminate manual overhead by automating routine tasks, reducing human error, and increasing operational consistency.

Advanced Reporting: Generate granular, data-driven reports tailored for internal audits and regulatory compliance requirements.

Unified Management: Simplify the administration of users, groups, licenses, and security settings across the M365 stack.

Proactive Auditing: Monitor tenant activities to identify anomalous behavior, unauthorized access attempts, and configuration drift.

Data Export: All reporting scripts feature optimized CSV output for easy integration with Excel, Power BI, or other data analysis tools.

Task Scheduling: Designed for headless execution; most scripts fully support Task Scheduler for periodic, hands-off reporting.

Extensible Architecture: Well-structured code allowing for easy customization to meet specific organizational requirements.

# Usage Instructions

Each script is designed to be independent, containing all necessary logic and error handling within the file.

Utilize built-in parameters and switches to filter results and target specific workloads (e.g., Exchange Online, SharePoint, Teams).

Detailed comments, syntax guides, and usage examples are included at the top of every script.

Ensure your execution policy is configured correctly and you have the necessary Microsoft Graph or module-specific permissions before running.
